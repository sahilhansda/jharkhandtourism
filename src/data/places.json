The cottages, built by Wood Barn India, combine Scandinavian luxury with Jharkhand’s tribal heritage, offering modern amenities like a gymnasium, cafeteria, and dedicated parking. Tourists can enjoy speed boating, trekking, and water sports, with plans for organized tours to enhance the experience. The resort’s serene setting, surrounded by the dam’s reservoir and lush greenery, provides a tranquil escape, making it a model for eco-tourism.
